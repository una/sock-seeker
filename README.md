# Slack Coding Challenge!

Inspired by Slack socks, I used the Google search API to implement a sock search.

## Prompt

Create a web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails; when a thumbnail is clicked, the photo should be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title. You can use any public API that returns photos.

## Contributing

This is a static site generated into the `dist/` folder, so opening *dist/index.html* will open the site. It is also hosted [here](http://una.im/sock-seeker).

The development environment is based on Gulp. To run a local server, first `npm install` dependencies, and then run `gulp`. Note: as a redundant method, running `npm run dev` will also initiate the default gulp task.
